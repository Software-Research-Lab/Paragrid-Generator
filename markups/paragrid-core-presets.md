# [Paragrid](https://github.com/Toy-Artificial-Intelligence-lab/paragrid-doc) Core structure presets output

Look into the interstellar bubble-craft porthole telescope and dive through the colorful cosmic streams of nebular depths to see the distant stars and systems on the edges of the colossal galaxy.
